# etg - an unfinished Enter the Gungeon assistant

the purpose of this program was to help me optimally pick items in [Enter the Gungeon](https://enterthegungeon.com/) game.
the thing is that the game has a bunch of active and passive items and guns and they form synergies when combined specifically.
so sometimes it is beneficial to pick a presumably worse item instead of a better one because that would complete a possibly powerful synergy

so the idea essentially was to create a repl in which I would enter items as I obtain them and then I could ask it whether this ir that item brings me closer to any synergy

this was never finished unfortunately but I did the data preparation step which included crawling the [wiki](https://enterthegungeon.fandom.com/wiki/Enter_the_Gungeon_Wiki) and designing a data model in which I believe I succeeded

I might finish this one day
